# YARG - Yet Another Rythm Game

This is my submission for the [LÃ–VE JAM 2025](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2025).

YARG is a mix between a shoot'em-up and a rythm-based game. Despite its name, I honestly don't know if it would qualify as a *real* rythm game.

What does my game have to do with the theme of the jam? Nothing lol (the theme was optional)
